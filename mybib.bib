	Abstract                 = {A proposed theory of planned behavior, an extension of I. Ajzen and M. Fishbein's (1980) theory of reasoned action, was tested in 2 experiments. In Exp I, 169 undergraduates' attendance of class lectures was recorded over a 6-wk period; in Exp II, with 90 undergraduates, the behavioral goal was getting an A in a course. Attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions were assessed. As expected, the theory of planned behavior permitted more accurate prediction of intentions and goal attainment than did the theory of reasoned action. In both experiments, perceived behavioral control added significantly to the prediction of intentions. Contrary to expectations, there was little evidence for interactions between perceived behavioral control and the theory's other independent variables.

Majasan's (1972) study which found that achievement in college psychology was greatest when the student's position on a scale of beliefs regarding behaviorism and humanism were similar to his instructor's. Further evidence on interactions in social psychology, personality, learning, and experimental psychology is cited. It is suggested that higher order interactions make it unlikely that social scientists will be able to establish generalizations applicable beyond the laboratory or that generalizations established in the field work will be maintained. Social research should be less concerned with hypothesis testing and more concerned with interpreting findings in local contexts.

	Abstract                 = {The dependency structure (unilateral or bilateral) between wholesale-distributors and their major suppliers is posited to infl{\"u}nce the type of contract (explicit or normative) used. In turn, dependency structure and type of contract is hypothesized to infl{\"u}nce wholesale-distributor performance. This process occurs both directly and indirectly through intermediate constructs, such as long-term orientation, relationship length, and relational behavior. The authors investigate 3 dependency structures: wholesaler dependent on supplier, supplier dependent on wholesaler, and high bilateral dependency. Results suggest that high bilateral dependency between a wholesale-distributor and its major supplier leads to more reliance on normative contracts. These normative contracts lead to improved wholesaler performance. Results also suggest that long-term orientation leads to more explicit and normative contracting, as well as to more relational behavior.

Snyder's Self-Monitoring Scale). After engaging in counterattitudinal behavior within a condition of perceived choice (Study 1), low self-monitoring Ss were more likely to accept their discrepant overt behavior as representative of their tr{\"u} attitudes than were high self-monitoring Ss, who were relatively unaffected by their attitude-discrepant behavior. In Study 2, the correlation between extremity of the counterattitudinal behavior and final attitude was high and positive for low self-monitoring Ss; behavior and attitudes were independent for high self-monitoring Ss. Implications for a conceptual formulation of the interaction between personal and social determinants of the relationship between behavior and attitudes are discussed.
